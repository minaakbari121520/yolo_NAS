# How to Train YOLO-NAS on Custom Dataset

This notebook is based on official [YOLO-NAS Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1q0RmeVRzLwRXW-h9dPFSOchwJkThUy6d?usp=sharing) by DECI AI.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

YOLO-NAS is still very fresh. If you notice that our notebook behaves incorrectly - especially if you experience errors that prevent you from going through the tutorial - don't hesitate! Let us know and open an [issue](https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks/issues) on the Roboflow Notebooks repository.

## Pro Tip: Use GPU Acceleration

If you are running this notebook in Google Colab, navigate to `Edit` -> `Notebook settings` -> `Hardware accelerator`, set it to `GPU`, and then click `Save`. This will ensure your notebook uses a GPU, which will significantly speed up model training times.

## Steps in this Tutorial

In this tutorial, we are going to cover:

- Before you start
- Install YOLO-NAS
- Inference with pre-trained COCO model
- Finding open source datasets
- ‚≠êÔ∏è Training YOLO-NAS on your custom dataset ‚≠êÔ∏è
- Load trained model
- Evaluate trained model
- Inference with trained model

## üî• Let's begin! 



## Inference with pre-trained COCO model

Start by instantiating a pretrained model. YOLO-NAS architecture comes in three different sizes: `yolo_nas_s`, `yolo_nas_m`, `and yolo_nas_l`. We will use `yolo_nas_l` throughout this notebook. Keep in mind that depending on your use-case your decision may be different. Take a peek at the diagram below visualizing the speed-accuracy tradeoff.
