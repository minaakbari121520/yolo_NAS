## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

YOLO-NAS is still very fresh. If you notice that our notebook behaves incorrectly - especially if you experience errors that prevent you from going through the tutorial - don't hesitate! Let us know and open an [issue](https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks/issues) on the Roboflow Notebooks repository.

## Pro Tip: Use GPU Acceleration

If you are running this notebook in Google Colab, navigate to `Edit` -> `Notebook settings` -> `Hardware accelerator`, set it to `GPU`, and then click `Save`. This will ensure your notebook uses a GPU, which will significantly speed up model training times.

## Steps in this Tutorial

In this tutorial, we are going to cover:

- Before you start
- Install YOLO-NAS
- Inference with pre-trained COCO model
- Finding open source datasets
- ‚≠êÔ∏è Training YOLO-NAS on your custom dataset ‚≠êÔ∏è
- Load trained model
- Evaluate trained model
- Inference with trained model
